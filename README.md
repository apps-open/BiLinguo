## BiLinguo


#### About

BiLinguo is designed for learning foreign languages. Now it is being developed in small steps but I has couple of new ideas to improve this application.

#### Privacy

This application is open source and absolutely free to use. I care about user's privacy so I use only open source and free tools and APIs to develop it.

#### Installation

First run command in terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/cyb3r-jamX/BiLinguo```

Or download and unpack .zip archive
Then, to build executable for your system, install pyinstaller and requirements using command:

```pip install pyinstaller```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Finally, run this command to build executable:

```pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole BiLinguo.py```

You'll find your application in the "dist" folder.

#### Perspectives

I have already added "Translate" feature, implemented new design. In the near future I am going to add such features as desktop notifications and a database import/export function. Hope you will like this applicaition. And may it help you learn new languages. Good Luck ;)
